1.  What is the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science?
Data Analytics focuses on analyzing data to answer specific questions. It can be considered as a subset of
Data Science, which may include data mining, machine learning, and other related disciplines.

2.  Explain how 2-dimensional data is processed by Python
2-dimensional data is stored in Python in a grid format similar to how data is stored on a spreadsheet.
The data in these multidimensional arrays must be of the same data type and indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.

3.  What skill sets are needed to become a Data Analyst?
To be a Data Analyst, you need to be good at mathematics, understand how to use programming languages like Python and
SQL, and have a good analytical mindset.

4.  Name at least two packages that are likely to be used with a Data Analytics and explain why they are useful.
The NumPy package is useful because it helps to create homogeneous multidimensional arrays,
which are a table of elements, all of the same data type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.
MatPlotLib is also useful because it helps present data in a  visual format for people to use.
